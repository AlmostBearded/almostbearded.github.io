        <p>
          My name is Peter Oberrauner. I am a software engineer currently
          employed as a frontend web developer at{" "}
          <a href="https://codefluegel.com/en/">CodeFl√ºgel</a> and finishing my
          Master's degree in software engineering and management on the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/">
            Graz University of Technology
          </a>
          . I have previously worked as a game developer at{" "}
          <a href="http://rarebyte.com/">Rarebyte</a> and have varying levels of
          experience in many major game engines/frameworks and am very
          comfortable with writing efficient code for all layers of a game.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am very passionate about clean code and efficient workflows and also
          consider myself a lifelong learner that's decently quick in picking up
          on new technologies. The trait that defines me the most is my love for
          games and game development but I also greatly enjoy programming and
          designing solutions that bring enjoyment and value to their users.

          Most of my time at the moment is spent on my employment, my university
          study and various side projects but I am always open for interesting
          projects as long as their schedule allows for enough flexibility to
          fit with my other responsibilities. You can simply contact me via{" "}
