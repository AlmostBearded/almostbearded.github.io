      My name is Peter Oberrauner. I am a software engineer currently employed
      as a frontend web developer at{" "}
      <a href="https://codefluegel.com/en/">CodeFl√ºgel</a> and finishing my
      Master's degree in software engineering and management on the{" "}
      <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/">Graz University of Technology</a>
      . I have previously worked as a game developer at{" "}
      <a href="http://rarebyte.com/">Rarebyte</a> and have varying levels of
      experience in many major game engines/frameworks and am very comfortable
      with writing efficient code for all layers of a game.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am very passionate about clean code and efficient workflows and also
      consider myself a lifelong learner that's decently quick in picking up on
      new technologies. The trait that defines me the most is my love for games
      and game development but I also greatly enjoy programming and designing
      solutions that bring enjoyment and value to their users.

      Most of my time at the moment is spent on my employment, my university
      study and various side projects but I am always open for interesting
      projects as long as their schedule allows for enough flexibility to fit
      with my other responsibilities. You can simply contact me via{" "}
