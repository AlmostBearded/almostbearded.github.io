The PIN Racer was the first project I worked on at [Rarebyte](http://rarebyte.com) back in 2016. It was a contract work for [Paysafecard](https://paysafecard.com) and it was played at their booth at [Gamescom](https://imgur.com/GQVlAs6) as well as other trade shows such as ESL and the Paris Games Week.

This game is an online multiplayer competitive hoverboard racing game that is played with Wii balance boards. It was specifically designed to be played at trade fairs, which means each race is only about 2 minutes long to ensure that the queued people didn't have to wait for too long. We also added a separate spectator client which is used to show the current race with a cinematic camera setup. If no race is in progress the spectator shows a replay from the previous race to draw people to the booth.

## Role

My main role on this project was the design and implementation of most of the gameplay code and the biggest challenge was the implementation of a control scheme that would assist players as much as possible without taking away too much control. The reason for such a design was that players would only have a few seconds to learn the game before the race would start and we wanted to eliminate the advantages of skilled players as much as possible. If you'd like to know how we did that, I did a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTUyY-mtgI0) about this topic at the [Game Dev Days](http://gamedevdays.com/) in 2016.
