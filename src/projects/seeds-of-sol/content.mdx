# Description

Seeds of Sol was the biggest project I worked on at [Rarebyte][raby]. We started development in late 2016 and the project was put on indefinite hold after about 2 years of development in 2018 because of focus and scope issues. The game was developed in Unity and we coded most of it in C# but used various assets for AI [behavior][bede] [trees][noca] and [visual scripting][flca] to allow our designers to quickly prototype gameplay themselves.

The game was originally envisioned to be a pretty difficult top-down twin-stick shooter with roguelike elements but that niche was kinda overflowing at the time and we didn't necessarily want to compete with other, very highly polished games in it. Because of that, we fell into a long period of prototyping to find other distinguishing mechanics to set Seeds of Sol apart. Among the things we experimented with were mechanics like a dual-wield system, an energy system and a companion with multi-personality disorder but, even though some of them had potential, we either failed to meaningfully incorporate them into the games core loop or didn't commit to them fully enough. This, combined with issues related to too early demoing, reliance on the wrong tools and scope growth led to an identity crisis of the project which in turn led to the decision to put it on hold and focus on other, more defined, projects.

Even though the development was very bumpy at times and I cursed the project on more than one occasion, it will always be the first, really big project I worked on and I treasure the memory of it and the team deeply. I aquired an incredible amount of technical knowledge and learned important lessons about project management, communication, community-building and loads more. This was also the project that made me realize that I wasn't particularly keen on relying on game development as my sole source of income which led to my decision to quit my job at [Rarebyte][raby] and switch to a more stable carreer in other fields of software engineering and get back to making games as a hobby.
